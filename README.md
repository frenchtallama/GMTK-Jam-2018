## Frenchtallama's GMTK Game Jam Submission

The [GMTK Game Jam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-bA1ZQWhUU) is a 48-hour game jam created and hosted by Mark Brown, the creator of Game Maker's Toolkit. The game jam theme is "Genre without Mechanic", based on the video [How Snake Pass Works] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NNPr2Ay4OM&). My submissions follow below.
